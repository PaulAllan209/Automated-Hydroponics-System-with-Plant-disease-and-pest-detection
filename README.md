## Automated-Hydroponics-System-with-Plant-disease-and-pest-detection

This repository contains the code and resources for a thesis capstone project that develops an automated hydroponics system using the Nutrient Film Technique (NFT). The system is designed to improve plant growth and efficiency by automating key aspects of hydroponic farming, including nutrient regulation and plant health monitoring.

**Key Features:**
- Automated regulation of electrical conductivity, pH, and water temperature to optimize plant growth.
- A Gantry Robot for 
- Machine learning-based plant health assessment using **AlexNet** and snail detection using **YOLOv8**, both integrated into a gantry robot for automated monitoring.

## Project Documentation
